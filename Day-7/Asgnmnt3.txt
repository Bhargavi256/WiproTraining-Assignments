 # Function to count the number of lines in a file
bhargavi@ChintuChikky:~$ count_lines() {
>   local filename=$1
>
>   if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
>     local line_count=$(wc -l < "$filename")
>     echo "The file '$filename' has $line_count lines."
>   else
>     echo "The file '$filename' does not exist."
>   fi
> }
